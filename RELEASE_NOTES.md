## ‚ú® What‚Äôs New

1. **Enhanced Save Keybindings**  
   - All dialogs now accept **Ctrl + Enter** (Windows/Linux) and **‚åò + Enter** (macOS) to save or accept.  

2. **Full Thread‚ÄêSafety Overhaul**  
   - Every signal from worker threads into the UI now uses `Qt.QueuedConnection`.  
   - Eliminated the ‚ÄúCannot create children for a parent in a different thread‚Äù Qt error.  

3. **Post-Queue Action Refinement**  
   - The **Keep** action is now a silent no-op (no warning).  
   - Shutdown, Sleep, Restart and Close are dispatched through the GUI thread to guarantee correct behavior.  

4. **UpdateManager Improvements**  
   - Unified OS detection via `platform.system()`.  
   - Broader macOS asset matching (Intel and Universal2 binaries).  
   - Graceful fallback around `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` on non-Windows Python builds.  

5. **YouTube URL Validator Extended**  
   - Now matches `youtube-nocookie.com` URLs.  
   - Strips trailing slashes before validation for more forgiving input.  

6. **Thumbnail Fetcher Optimized**  
   - Reuses a single `requests.Session` (with optional proxy).  
   - Retries each URL up to 3 times with exponential backoff.  
   - Filters out tiny placeholder images (< 1 KiB).  
   - Writes atomically via a temp file, then renames into place.  

7. **Styles & High-DPI Support**  
   - Enabled `Qt.AA_EnableHighDpiScaling` and `Qt.AA_UseHighDpiPixmaps`.  
   - Dynamically scales fonts, padding and radii based on the screen‚Äôs DPI.

### üìä VirusTotal Scan
[üîó View scan results on VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com)
